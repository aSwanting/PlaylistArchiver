# YouTube Playlist Archiver

The YouTube Playlist Archiver is a web tool designed to help locate old, deleted, or private YouTube videos using archive.org's Wayback Machine. It scans a YouTube playlist, attempts to retrieve snapshots of videos, and fetches page titles that usually correspond to the video titles.
